printer on ubuntu just a week after was released  the drivers that ubuntu tries to install by default from the gutenprint project fail so i have to do it manually possibly if ubuntu polishes and fixes the default installation method it may work in the future as it was working by default in ubuntu   i am connecting to the printer via usb in a later version of this tutorial i will explain how to
