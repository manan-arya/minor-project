So, if you have not done any tweaking with the permission of running the command just put the cron entry in the root user's cron (<code>sudo crontab -e</code>) or add the entry in <code>/etc/crontab</code> mentioning the user as root.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT (Regarding Anacron):</strong> Absolutely bad idea. generally anacron is used while you want to run a command daily but you are not sure whether your computer will be On or Off. So lets say you have added an anacron entry to run a command. Then if the computer is On anacron checks and runs the command, if the computer was Off on that specified time the instant you turn On the computer next time anacron will run that command. </p>\\n\\n<p>So, in a nutshell anacron is used while you are not sure your computer is gonna be On or Off. In your case you are shutting down the computer so if you put that to run by anacron your computer will be shut down by anacron if it was off and when you will turn it On after the specified time. </p>\\n\\n<p>Your command</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron || : 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>means that run <code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron</code> first, if that fails run <code>30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now</code> makes no sense i think.

It is part\\n  of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or\\n  device. The disk lock can be enabled and disabled by sending special\\n  ATA commands to the drive. If a disk is locked, it will refuse all\\n  access until it is unlocked.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master\\n  password.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum\\n  security mode. In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with\\n  either the User or Master password. There is an attempt limit,\\n  normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or\\n  hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>In Maximum security mode, the disk can be unlocked only with the User\\n  password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining\\n  way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to\\n  issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by\\n  SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT\\n  command requires the Master password and will completely erase all\\n  data on the disk. The operation is slow, it may take longer than half\\n  an hour or more, depending on the size of the disk.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Hard Disk imaging</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.clonezilla.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clonezilla</a> is an great tool to image HDDs and partitions, but I don\\'t know if it can generate images from encrypted disks, but you can certainly clone the whole disk using <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/a/2725/65926\">dd</a>.

There is no objective answer I suppose. </p>\\n\\n<p>Of course you should certainly upgrade before the support ends and for 12.04 it means before April 2017. One reason to upgrade would be that as Ubuntu is coming to phones and tablets it must become more resource efficient. As people claim 13.04 delivers notable improvements in that sense. That means, it is likely to do the same tasks faster.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, if your not an enthusiast who just enjoys new things and don't care if they don't work then it makes sense to wait before moving to new release. After first few months there is hope that most critical bugs have been revealed and fixed. </p>\\n\\n<p>I am using 12.04 myself and really wondering whether it is worth the trouble of upgrading to 13.04. Even if you use the release upgrade feature it makes sense to make backups as things might go wrong (as you can read from various questions here) and the whole process takes time and effort.

Put this in your <code>.bashrc</code> file to try:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\\n    echo \"$(($@))\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So now, you don\\'t even need <code>$((...))</code> anymore, just <code>=</code> which seems natural enough.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Replacement</h3>\\n\\n<p>Another thing if you want to be even faster: you can make it replace <code>p</code> with <code>+</code> and <code>x</code> with <code>*</code>. This will work for that:</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\\n    echo \"$(($calc))\"\\n}\\n\\n= 5 x 5  # Returns 25\\n= 50p25  # Returns 75\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now you don\\'t even need <kbd>Shift</kbd> anymore, the only thing is <code>=&nbsp;</code> in front of arithmetic.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Hexadecimal output</h3>\\n\\n<p>Output can be displayed in both decimal and hexadecimal, if so desired. (<strong>Note</strong>: using <code>x</code> substitution will conflict with the <code>0x...</code> hex syntax)</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\\n    answer=\"$(($@))\"\\n    printf \\'%s\\' \"$answer\"\\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt; \"obase=16;ans=$answer;print \\\\\" (0x\\\\\",ans,\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\"\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>(uses Bash for arithmetic, but bc for final decimal to hex conversion)</p>\\n\\n<p>Example: </p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>$ = 16 + 0x10\\n272 (0x110)\\n\\n$ = 16**3 + 16**4\\n69632 (0x11000)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<h2>Using bc</h2>\\n\\n<p>If you want slightly more advanced calculations, you can pipe it to <code>bc</code> like so:</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt;\"scale=10;$calc\"\\n}\\n\\n= \\'sqrt(2)\\' # Returns 1.4142135623\\n= \\'4*a(1)\\'  # Returns pi (3.1415926532)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The functions provided by <code>bc</code> are as follows (and can be found from <code>man bc</code>):</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sqrt ( expression )\\n       The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression.  \\n       If the expression is negative, a run time error is generated.\\n\\ns (x)  The sine of x, x is in radians.\\n\\nc (x)  The cosine of x, x is in radians.\\n\\na (x)  The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.\\n\\nl (x)  The natural logarithm of x.\\n\\ne (x)  The exponential function of raising e to the value x.\\n\\nj (n,x)\\n       The Bessel function of integer order n of x.\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>It also supports <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> and variables like a programming language though if it may be better to write to a file if you wanted that.</p>\\n\\n<p>Keep in mind that it will substitute <code>p</code> and <code>x</code> in function/variable names. It may be better to just remove the replacements.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Using gcalccmd</h2>\\n\\n<p>You can also make the function call <code>gcalccmd</code> (from <code>gnome-calculator</code>) like so:</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\\n    calc=\"$@\"\\n    # Uncomment the below for (p → +) and (x → *)\\n    #calc=\"${calc//p/+}\"\\n    #calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\\n    echo -ne \"$calc\\\\n quit\" | gcalccmd | sed \\'s:^&gt; ::g\\'\\n}\\n\\n= \\'sqrt(2)\\' # Returns 1.4142135623\\n= \\'4^4\\'     # Returns 256\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The available functions seem to be (taken straight from <a href=\"http://sourcecodebrowser.com/gcalctool/5.29.2/mp-equation_8c.html#a2c1b83394ed2fe6da08e1538b65fd29b\">the source code</a>), <code>==</code> denotes equivalent functions:</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>ln()\\nsqrt()\\nabs()\\nint()\\nfrac()\\nsin()\\ncos()\\ntan()\\nsin⁻¹() == asin()\\ncos⁻¹() == acos()\\ntan⁻¹() == atan()\\nsinh()\\ncosh()\\ntanh()\\nsinh⁻¹() == asinh()\\ncosh⁻¹() == acosh()\\ntanh⁻¹() == atanh()\\nones()\\ntwos()\\n</code></pre>\\n',\n",

       "   'answer': {'text': '<p>From the MAN PAGES:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Shutdown</strong> - \"shutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All\\n       logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and,  within\\n       the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.\" Time mentioned here is an amount specify by the user that is shutting down.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Halt</strong> - \"These programs allow a system administrator to reboot, halt or poweroff\\n       the system.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The difference is that Halt can be more \"aggressive\" when shutting down than Shutdown itself. It has parameters than can literally force the system to shutdown without regarding services or opened programs. If you run halt without any parameters it will simply execute the shutdown command. Something like an alias. If you run it for example with the parameter <code>--force</code> it will \"force\" the system into a reboot really fast.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the case of halt or shutdown, they will wait for all processes to finish correctly before turning the PC off or rebooting. If a service or app does not close or does not close properly you will see what you mention there (The ubuntu logo with the dots).</p>\\n\\n<p>The proper way in the terminal for a single user or multi user is shutdown. But if the shutdown is not working verify what services you have running and which one is causing the slowness or freezing of the shutdown.</p>\\n\\n<p>With that in mind, there are several ways to reboot or shutdown the system:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Rebooting</strong> - <code>shutdown -r</code>, <code>reboot</code></p>\\n\\n<p>In this case, reboot is simply calling <code>shutdown -r</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Shutting Down</strong> - <code>halt</code>, <code>shutdown</code>, <code>sudo init 0</code>, <code>shutdown -h now</code>, <code>poweroff</code></p>\\n\\n<p>In this case, <code>poweroff</code> is the same as calling <code>shutdown -P</code></p>\\n\\n<p>As you have noticed, The <code>shutdown</code> command can do a lot of stuff, here is a small list of it:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down\\n-h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system\\n-H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down\\n-P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down\\n-c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE\\n-k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring the system down\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>As does the <code>reboot</code> </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>-f, --force                 force reboot or halt, don\\'t call shutdown(8)\\n-p, --poweroff              switch off the power when called as halt\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>There is however a difference between shutdown down through the terminal and clicking on the Shutdown option in Unity. The latter will ask the user for interaction with any unsaved work (like libreoffice, inkscape...). the former will simply send a signal to all processes telling them to close. No user interaction will be needed so any unsaved work will be gone.</p>\\n',\n",
